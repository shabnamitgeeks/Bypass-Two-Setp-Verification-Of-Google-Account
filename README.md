FA or 2-factor authentication is an additional protection layer to the already existing login information. This ensures that the person trying to log in to an online account is who they say they are.

In other words, 2FA kicks in right after you enter your username and password, but before gaining access to the account. Instead, with 2FA Gmail, you need to provide an extra piece of info.

How to Bypass 2FA Gmail Protection?
Can 2FA be bypassed?

Of course, and there are several methods this can be done. We'll talk about the five most common, but if you're interested, read this report by KnowBe4 which mentions 11 ways to bypass Google 2-Step verification.

1) Using the Password Reset Function
This is what the hackers did in the example above. They sent a fake Gmail alert, phished an SMS token and finally had their victims reset their passwords. 

2) Using an OAuth Mechanism
Another 2FA Gmail bypassing method is to use a 3rd party login mechanism called OAuth. If you're not familiar with OAuth, this is when you use Google or Facebook to log in to another account. 

Although this is a convenient way to log in to a website and Google or Facebook should be safe, it's also a way for the hacker to bypass 2FA. Instead, they can use OAuth integration to log in without needing the login credentials.

3) Using Race Conditions
 A “race condition” is the repeated usage of a previously known value, such as the app's ability to use used or unused tokens later. For this, the hacker would first need to have access to those previous values, which they can get by intercepting a previous code.

4) Using Brute Force
Finally, if there is no rate limitation in the input fields, an attacker can attempt to brute force the 2FA code, especially if it's number-based. As the normal length of a code is 4-6 numbers, that's “only” 151,800 possibilities. You don't need a supercomputer to crack that.

5) Using Social Engineering
For this, the hacker needs to have the target's username and password already. With that, they can send out an email to their victim, with a Google verification code request that was sent to the target's number. Once the target sends the code, the attacker can easily bypass 2FA.

In another case scenario, the hacker can trick the user into clicking on a phishing link in an email, where the user will provide their credentials.

Then, the hacker can use these to log in to the real site. When the target also receives and enters the code, the hacker will see this on the fake site and can enter the code on the real site to bypass 2FA.
